A RESTful API for WordPress

== Description ==

ConvurtÂ® is an iOS and Android app with a web management dashboard for website owners, bloggers, agencies, copywriters and content creators.  

The WordPress plugin will automatically pull in voice recordings that have been converted to content as a draft post on your blog. 

Download the iOS or Android app, sign up for an account, and get your access key from your profile to connect the WordPress plugin.  Then each time you have your voice converted to a blog post, it will sync automatically to your Wordpress blog as a draft post.

Convurt allows you to retrieve and manipulate WordPress content using HTTP requests. There are three main goals:

1. Provide a simple, consistent external interface
2. Create a stable, understandable internal implementation
3. Enable new types of extensions for WordPress
4. User can get posts from the convurt app.

This plugin was created at Convurt, LLC (https://convurt.io/) for getting posts from the voice to text conversion app. Using the app, we convert users voice to text. All of the text will be imported using this plugin as a draft post.

See the [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/convurt/other_notes/) section for the complete documentation.
